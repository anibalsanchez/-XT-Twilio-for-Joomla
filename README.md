## Add a Click To Call Button & SMS Chat to Your Joomla Site

As a Joomla community volunteer, I am always looking for opportunities to help my favorite CMS grow and add new features. Following these ideas, Twilio and Joomla are a perfect match to bring the possibilities of a first-level communication platform to small and medium-size organizations. In this blog post, I am going to create the required extensions for Joomla to incorporate a simple communication channel to a website by creating a click to call button.

I have planned a series of articles about the topic of implementing a communication solution for Joomla based on Twilio. In this first installment, I provide a ready-to-use extension for Joomla and the detailed steps to implement it (no coding skills are required). Later on, I’ll publish the rationale behind the development process.

If you are looking for a simple solution, you can just download the latest release and deploy it on your site.

## How to Customize a Joomla Extension for SMS Chat

From Twilio's Blog: In the article Add a Click To Call Button & SMS Chat to Your Joomla Site, I presented a ready-to-use extension, XT Twilio for Joomla to implement a simple communication channel on a website.

## How to Validate a Phone Number in a Joomla Extension

From Twilio's Blog: In the article Add a Click To Call Button & SMS Chat to Your Joomla Site, I presented a ready-to-use extension, XT Twilio for Joomla to implement a simple communication channel on a website. The basic extension sends SMS messages (or supports a Click2Call workflow) between users and the sales area. In the second article of this series, How to Customize a Joomla Extension for SMS Chat, I presented a case to add the client name field to the extension and personalize the SMS messaging.

In this tutorial, to tackle the complexity of handling international telephone numbers properly following the E.164 standard, I’m going to introduce the integration of an advanced JavaScript plugin for entering and validating international telephone numbers, jackocnr/intl-tel-input. The plugin adds a flag dropdown to any input, detects the user's country, displays a relevant placeholder and provides formatting/validation methods. For a complete description of the plugin features, please visit https://intl-tel-input.com/.
