## Add a Click To Call Button & SMS Chat to Your Joomla Site
From Twilio's Blog: **Add a Click To Call Button & SMS Chat to Your Joomla Site**

As a Joomla community volunteer, I am always looking for opportunities to help my favorite CMS grow and add new features. Following these ideas, Twilio and Joomla are a perfect match to bring the possibilities of a first-level communication platform to small and medium-size organizations. In this blog post, I am going to create the required extensions for Joomla to incorporate a simple communication channel to a website by creating a click to call button.

I have planned a series of articles about the topic of implementing a communication solution for Joomla based on Twilio. In this first installment, I provide a ready-to-use extension for Joomla and the detailed steps to implement it (no coding skills are required). Later on, I’ll publish the rationale behind the development process.

If you are looking for a simple solution, you can just download the latest release and deploy it on your site.
